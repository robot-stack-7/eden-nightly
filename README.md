### 🚀 PGO Optimized Builds

Profile-Guided Optimization (**PGO**) is now being tested via clang for Eden nightly.  
PGO builds can improve runtime performance by **5–10% FPS** compared to non-PGO builds, depending on the game and workload.

</p>

For now, PGO builds are provided alongside regular builds. 
They are extremely experimental with unstable performance boost across different builds even with the same game.

### 🐧 Linux Builds

The builds for Linux are built with several CPU-specific compliler optimization flags targeting:

- **Steam Deck** — optimized for Steam Deck’s APU architecture (AMD Zen 2)
- **ROG ALLY & Similar Handhelds** — optimized for next-gen handhelds APUs (AMD Zen 4)
- **Modern x86_64 CPUs** — optimized for `x86-64-v3`, targets CPUs from roughly 2015 and later for a performance boost (via the Common Build)
- **Legacy x86_64 CPUs** — compatible with baseline `x86-64`, means can run on virtually all 64-bit x86 processors (via the Legacy Build)
- **AArch64 devices** — compatible with `aarch64` architecture

AppImages built using [**Sharun**](https://github.com/VHSgunzo/sharun) are bundled with **Mesa drivers** to ensure maximum compatibility — similar to Eden’s official releases and may include the latest fixes for certain games (though untested). These builds should work on any linux distro.

A newly added **AppBundle** version, built with [**pelf**](https://github.com/xplshn/pelf), serves as an alternative to AppImage. It's a lightweight format written in Go and intended for broader Linux compatibility.

### 🤖 Android Builds

Eden nightly for Android is available in four versions:

- **Replace** Build
  
Shares the same application ID as the official Eden release. Installing this version will replace the official app on your device. It appears as "**Eden**" on the home screen.

- **Coexist** Build
  
Uses a nightly application ID, allowing it to coexist with the official Eden release. It appears as "**Eden Nightly**" on the home screen.

- **Optimized** Build
  
Using com.miHoYo.Yuanshen for application ID to enable device dependent features such as AI frame generation. It appears as "**Eden Optimized**" on the home screen.

- **Legacy** Build
  
Apply patches that improve compatibility with older GPUs (e.g. Snapdragon 865) at the cost of performance. It appears as "**Eden Legacy**" on the home screen.
